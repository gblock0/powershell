  > A bash inspired readline implementation for PowerShell
  >
  > This module replaces the command line editing experience of PowerShell for versions 3 and up. It provides:
  >
  > - Syntax coloring
  > - Simple syntax error notification
  > - A good multi-line experience (both editing and history)
  > - Customizable key bindings
  > - Cmd and emacs modes (neither are fully implemented yet, but both are usable)
  > - Many configuration options
  > - Bash style completion (optional in Cmd mode, default in Emacs mode)
  > - Bash/zsh style interactive history search (CTRL-R)
  > - Emacs yank/kill ring
  > - PowerShell token based "word" movement and kill
  > - Undo/redo
  > - Automatic saving of history, including sharing history across live sessions
  > - "Menu" completion (somewhat like Intellisense, select completion with arrows) via Ctrl+Space
